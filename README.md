Hello everyone ! Me and my classmate Himateju has designed and devloped this website called incognito for our college IT fest. We have used HTML5, CSS and javascript in our website, Participants from other college can browse our website and gather information about the happening events and they can even register thourgh the website itself. There is a schedule tab where partcipants can kanow at what time the events starts and where.

The website is linked with the google's firebase which is basically a database, we can store data and retrive data through it.

Hope you like our website go give it a check - https://incognito-2024.pages.dev/
